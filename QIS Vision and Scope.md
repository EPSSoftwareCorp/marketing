## Overview

**"If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!" - _Benjamin Franklin_**

Planning is the key to every successful software project, and CODE&#39;s Vision &amp; Scope Process will provide your team with a plan to make your project a success. No matter what size or type of software project you are considering, use CODE&#39;s experience and expertise to clearly define and plan your project.

##### **How We Can Help**

Our Vision &amp; Scope Process is a detailed breakdown of your software application by members of the CODE Consulting team. Our goal is construct the plan for your new application by meeting with your team to gain an understanding of your applications needs and company goals.   Two experienced CODE Consultants work with your company on-site or remotely to define what your application does, how your application accomplishes its tasks, what changes need to be made, and what roadblocks may exist. We then begin working on the **Vision & Scope document** , a high-level roadmap outlining a plan to successfully achieve your goals. The Vision &amp; Scope document also recommends technologies, platforms, methodologies, and a host of other items based upon your project needs and our experience of what works.

Once the Vision &amp; Scope document is reviewed and accepted by your company,  CODE consultants begin working on a **labor forecast** that provides a time-based estimate for creating your new application. Everything is taken into account on this labor forecastâ€”development, project management, testing, training, mentoring, meetings, and more.  The forecast is a starting point and is negotiable in terms of which processes you would like CODE to be involved with. Both the Vision and Scope document and the labor forecast become the property of your company and can be used to successfully move forward with development whether you are using in-house resources, CODE consultants, other outside resources or some combination of the above.
