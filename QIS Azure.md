## Overview

Microsoft Azure is a complete cloud platform designed to host your existing applications, speed up the development of new applications, and enhance existing applications as well. It is a set of cloud services designed to help your organization meet your business challenges. Use it to develop, test, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

Add cloud capabilities to your existing network infrastructure with its platform as a service (PaaS) model, or use it for all of your computing and network needs with its Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model. Both options provide secure, reliable access to your cloud hosted data. Azure&#39;s ever-expanding products and services are designed to meet your needs through a single, convenient, easy to manage platform.

##### Services

With Azure hosting, you can start small and easily scale your application up as demand grows. Azure provides the reliability you need for high-availability applications including failover between different data centers during a disaster. Your Azure services are easily managed from the Azure portal or programmatically via service-specific APIs and templates.

Azure offers a number of ways of storing data in the cloud including Azure SQL Database which is an intelligent, fully managed relational cloud database service providing SQL Server compatibility.
